# Responsive-Web-Design-Certification
### In the Responsive Web Design Certification, learners learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

### First, they built a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, they learned modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a quiz site.

### Finally, they learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with Flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.
